Description: SPRINT (Simple Parallel R INTerface) is a parallel
        framework for R. It provides a High Performance Computing (HPC)
        harness which allow R scripts to run on HPC clusters. SPRINT
        contains a library of selected R functions that have been
        parallelized. Functions are named after the original R function
        with the added prefix 'p', i.e. the parallel version of cor()
        in SPRINT is called pcor(). Call to the parallel R functions
        are included directly in standard R scripts.
