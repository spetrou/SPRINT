Description: SPRINT (Simple Parallel R INTerface) is a parallel framework for 
             R. It provides a High Performance Computing (HPC) harness which 
             allow R scripts to run on HPC clusters. SPRINT contains a library 
             of selected R functions that have been parallelized. Functions 
             are named after the original R function with the added prefix 
             'p', i.e. the parallel version of cor() in SPRINT is called 
             pcor(). Call to the parallel R functions are included directly 
             in standard R scripts.
