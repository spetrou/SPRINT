---------------
1. Introduction
---------------

SPRINT (Simple Parallel R INTerface) is a parallel framework for R. It 
provides a High Performance Computing (HPC) harness which allow R scripts to 
run on HPC clusters. SPRINT contains a library of selected R functions that 
have been parallelized. Functions are named after the original R function with
the added prefix 'p', i.e. the parallel version of cor() in SPRINT is called 
pcor(). Call to the parallel R functions are included directly in standard R 
scripts.


---------------
2. Requirements
---------------

 * R - latest version, SPRINT was tested using 2.10.1, 2.10.0 and 2.9.2.
 * MPI2 - any version will full MPI-2 support will work, although there are
          complications when using non-gcc compilers. MPICH2 is
	   preferred. LAM/MPI implementation is not supported. 
 * Unix/Linux - SPRINT is designed for HPC systems and these all run on
                Unix/Linux.

a. Notes
--------
  
 * ff package is also needed but only when using the pcor() function. SPRINT 
   was tested using version 2.1-1. ff is available from CRAN 
  (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff/index.html).
 
 * There are known issues with open MPI parallel file IO support. SPRINT 
   pcor() function uses MPI-IO and tests carried on an installation with open 
   MPI 1.3.2 on IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) have shown 
   inconsistent results. Sometimes wrong results were written out to file by 
   one or more processes when using pcor() on more than one node. The SPRINT 
   team therefore strongly recommends NOT to use open MPI.  

 * On some systems (in particular the UK national supercomputing
   service HECToR), the temporary directories created by the slave R
   processes are not cleaned up correctly.  To work around this, one
   must periodically clean out the temporary directories by hand.

--------------------
3. Installing SPRINT
--------------------

SPRINT is distributed as a single compressed tar file. All source files are
included in one single directory called 'sprint'.

The installation process is carried out with a single command line from the
directory containing SPRINT:

> R CMD INSTALL sprint

If you are using a central installation of R and do not have the root 
privileges to install libraries there, you can install the sprint library 
locally by setting $R_LIBS accordingly.

> R CMD INSTALL -l $R_LIBS sprint 

a. Notes
--------

 * optional arguments to the installation command:

   --configure-args="--with-wrapper-script=$WRAPPER_SCRIPT"

   where:

   WRAPPER_SCRIPT contains the compiler to be used for building SPRINT, e.g.
   "mpicc".
   
   The configure script automatically identifies the appropriate compiler for
   building SPRINT. This option should only be used if the script fails to 
   locate the MPI compiler. 
   

b. Testing the Installation
---------------------------

  * The SPRINT library includes a function to test the installation called
    ptest(). It simply prints a message identifying each processor in the 
    compute cluster. For example, use SPRINT with 5 processors and you will 
    get the following output:
             
    [1] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 0" "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 2"
    [3] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 1" "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 3"
    [5] "HELLO, FROM PROCESSOR: 4" 

    Run the following sample R script, install_test.R:

    	library("sprint")
    	ptest()
    	pterminate()
    	quit()

    > mpiexec -n 5 R -f install_test.R


---------------
4. Using SPRINT
---------------

To make use of SPRINT it is first necessary to include the library. Within 
your R script use 'library("sprint")'. Then include calls to the SPRINT 
functions you wish to use. Note that you must use an R script, rather than 
simply typing in the commands into R. This is due to most High Performance 
Computing (HPC) machines executing codes on a 'back-end' rather than 
interactively. It is worth testing your script on your desktop first with the 
unparallelized versions, before running it on a HPC machine. Finally, all 
SPRINT enabled scripts require that pterminate() is called before the final 
quit() command. This calls MPI_FINALIZE and shuts down SPRINT.

For example, a simple R script which calls one single function called ptest()
will look like this:

    library("sprint")
    ptest()
    pterminate()
    quit()

This only gives access to SPRINT within R, it will not give you multiple
processors. You will need to run MPI to do this. How this done dependents on
your system set-up. You will have to specified the location of the script name
and the number of processors to be used.

For example, this command will run the install_test.R script on 5
processors.

	> mpiexec -n 5 R -f install_test.R

The available functions in SPRINT are:
 - pcor(): a parallel Pearson's correlation
 - pmaxT(): a permutation test function
 - ptest(): a simple test function to test SPRINT

a. pcor()
---------

Pcor() carried out a parallel Pearson's correlation. It takes a 2D array as 
input and correlates each row with every other row. If both data_x and
data_y matrices are passed on input the correlations between the
columns of data_x and data_y are computed. The output can either be
the matrix of corelation coefficient or the distance matrix.

To use pcor():

    pcor(data_x, data_y = NULL, distance = FALSE, caching_ =
    "mmeachflush", filename_ = NULL)

where:

    - 'data_x' is the input matrix data,
    - 'data_y' is the second input matrix with compatible dimensions
       to data_x.
    - 'distance' is a boolean indicating whether the output is to be a 
      distance matrix rather than the correlation coefficient matrix,
    - 'caching_' caching scheme for the backend, currently "mmnoflush" or
      "mmeachflush" (flush mmpages at each swap) if no name is specified
      the default value is "mmeachflush",
    - 'filename' is a string and is optional. It specifies the name of
      a file where the results will be saved. By default, the results are
      saved to a temporary file that is delete after exiting from SPRINT.

Examples of valid calls to pcor are:

    - ff_obj <- pcor(t(inData))
    - ff_obj <- pcor(t(inData_X), t(inData_Y))
    - ff_obj <- pcor(t(inData), filename_="output.dat") 
    - ff_obj <- pcor(data, caching_="mmeachflush", filename_="output.dat")
    - ff_obj <- pcor(t(inData), distance=TRUE, filename_="output.dat")
    
The first three are parallel equivalent to the call the sequential cor():

    results <- cor(t(inData))
	
The last one also implements a parallel equivalent to cor() but return a 
different output that is the distance matrix.	

b. pmaxT()
----------

PmaxT() implements a parallel version of the multtest mt.maxT function. It 
computes the adjusted p-values for step-down multiple testing procedures. 

To use pmaxT():

	pmaxT(X, classlabel, test = "t", side = "abs", B = 10000, 
	      na = .mt.naNUM, fixed.seed.sampling = "y", nonpara = "n") 
where:

	- 'X' is the input data array,
	- 'classlabel' is the class labels of the columns of the input dataset,
	- 'test' is the statistical method used for testing the null hypothesis. 
	  The following six methods are supported:
	  	. t: Tests based on a two-sample Welch t-statistics 
	  		 (unequal variances)
		. t.equalvar: tests based on a two-sample t-statistics with equal 
		              variance for the two samples.
		. Wilcoxon: Tests based on standardized rank sum Wilcoxon statistics.
		. F: Tests based on F-statistics.
		. Pair-T: Tests based on paired t-statistics.
		. Block-F: Tests based on F-statistics which adjust for block 
		           differences.
	- 'side' is the type of rejection region. The following values are 
	  available:
	  	. "abs" for absolute difference
	  	. "upper" for the maximum difference
	  	. "lower" for the minimum difference
	- 'B' is the number of permutations. If set to "0" then the complete 
	   permutations of the data will be computed. 
	- 'na' is the representation used for missing values. Missing values are
	  excluded from all computations.    
	- 'fixed.seed.sampling' can either be: 
		. "y" to compute the permutations on the fly
		. "n" to save all permutations in memory prior to computations
	- 'nonpara' can either be:
	    . "y" for non-parametric test statistics
	    . "n" otherwise.
		                        
The interface and parameters to the parallel pmaxt() are identical to those 
for the sequential mt.maxt():

    mt.maxT(X, classlabel, test = "t", side = "abs", B = 10000, 
            na = .mt.naNUM, fixed.seed.sampling = "y", nonpara = "n") 

c. ppam()
----------

Parallel partitioning of the data into k clusters "around
medoids". The original pam function accepts both a distance matrix and
a raw data on input. By the raw data we mean a table of coordinates of all
the observations. The parallel version of the function limits this
choice only to a pre-computed distance matrix. The optional distances
calculation was excluded from ppam. The distance matrix can be
calculated using SPRINT's pcor() function with the 'distance'
parameter set to TRUE.

To use ppam():

       ppam (x, k, medoids = NULL, is_dist = inherits(x, "dist"),
         cluster.only = FALSE, do.swap = TRUE, trace.lev = 0)

where:

       - x: data matrix or ff object (symmetric) or dissimilarity
         matrix, depending on the value of the diss argument.
       - k: positive integer specifying the number of clusters, less
         that the number of observations. 
       - medoids: NULL (default) or length-k vector of integer indices
         specifying initial medoids instead of using the build
         algorithm. 
       - is_dist: logical flag: if TRUE (default for dist or
         dissimilarity objects), then x will be considered as a
         dissimilarity matrix. If FALSE, then x will be considered as
         a symmetric matrix. 
       - cluster.only: logical; if true, only the clustering will be
         computed and returned 
       - do.swap: logical indicating if the *swap* phase should
         happen. The default, TRUE, correspond to the original
         algorithm.  On the other hand, the *swap* phase is much more
         computer intensive than the *build* one for large n, so can
         be skipped by do.swap = FALSE. 
       - trace.lev: integer specifying a trace level for printing
         diagnostics during the build and swap phase of the
         algorithm. Default 0 does not print anything; higher values
         print  

Examples:

	# pcor returns ff object as a result
	mcor <- pcor(matrix(rnorm(1:10000), ncol=100), distance = TRUE)
	p1m <- ppam(mcor, 4)
	p2m <- ppam(mcor, 4, medoids = c(1,16))
	p3m <- ppam(mcor, 3, trace = 2)

	p4m <- ppam(dist(x), 12)


d. Performances
---------------
SPRINT parallel functions, run on multiple processors reducing the
time taken for the calculation to complete. Note, that the speed-up
depends heavily on the size of the data set being analyzed. A small
data set will show no speed-up on 3 or more processors. However, tests
on larger data sets have shown an almost perfect scaling for up to 512
cores. 

------------------------------------------------
 5. Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------

Know issues in open MPI result in unreliable results when running pcor() on 
more than one node, see section 2.a. Sometimes the result matrix will be 
wrong. The symptoms for this issue are entire columns of zero (0) values and
data shifted towards the right, especially the expected diagonal line of one 
(1) values.  

 
------------------------------------------------
 6. Configuration of Systems used to test SPRINT
------------------------------------------------

SPRINT beta 0.3.0 has been developed and tested on an internal cluster, Ness
(http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/facilities/ness/), a local cluster, ECDF
(http://www.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/) and on the UK national supercomputing service, 
HECToR (http://www.hector.ac.uk/).
